			<h3> What is this site? </h3>

			This site is a URL shortener, built in just a little over a week!
 			
 			<p> What inspired me to create one for myself was the news that Google was planning to discontinue their link shortener. Although it should be noted that in no way is this shortener the same level as Google's.
			<p> It has been a very educational journey. Along the way, I learned about query serialization in databases, endpoints, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with the get(), post(), put(), and delete() methods, as well as data management and data hashing with salt.
			<p> There were accidents in the early stages of development, such as database corruption, accidentally deleting important logs, and  deleting the codebase twice (thankfully, I had backups).
			<p> Unfortunately, this project will remain just a repository due to the costs of running such a service. It will stay open source, and updates on vulnerabilities will be provided over time, although timely patches are not guaranteed.
